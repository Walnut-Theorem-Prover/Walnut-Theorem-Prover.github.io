<H1> What is Walnut?</H1>

Walnut is free software, written in Java, for
deciding first-order statements about the non-negative
integers, phrased in an extension of
Presburger arithmetic, called Buchi arithmetic.  It
can be used to provide rigorous proofs or disproofs of 
hundreds of assertions in combinatorics
on words, number theory, and other areas of discrete
mathematics. It can handle a wide variety of problems, and has been
used to disprove false claims in the literature, as well as solve
open problems.

<H1> Where can I download Walnut? </H1>

The latest version of Walnut can be downloaded for free at <a href="https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover">https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover</a>.

<H1> Where is the documentation about Walnut? </H1>

Please see the <a href="https://github.com/Walnut-Theorem-Prover/Walnut/wiki">Walnut wiki</a> for the most up-to-date documentation about Walnut!
<br>
<br>
To learn even more about Walnut, see Jeff's <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/walnut.html">Walnut page</a>.
There are links to his book, videos, and more Walnut examples and exercises there once you have mastered the basics of Walnut.

<H1> I don't want to install it, can I just try it out in a web 
browser?</H1>

Yes!  Thanks to 
<a href="https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/Nicolas.Ollinger/">Nicolas Ollinger</a>, you can go to <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nopid/jupywalnut/main?urlpath=/lab/tree/notebooks/">this URL</a>.  It takes about 15-30 seconds to load.
Once it loads, click the button that says "New &#9660;" and select "Walnut".
You will now see a blue rectangle.  You can now type in Walnut commands
and click on the small black right-pointing
triangle &#9656; to run them.  Try, for example
<P>
<tt> eval tm_has_overlap "Ei,n n>=1 & Aj (j<=n) => T[i+j]=T[i+n+j]": </tt>
</P>
which is Walnut's way of writing the first-order logic assertion
<P>
&exist; <i>i, n</i> &nbsp; <i>n</i> &ge; 1 and &forall; <i>j</i> (<i>j</i>
&le; <i>n</i>) &rArr; <b>t</b><sub><i>i</i>+<i>j</i></sub> =
<b>t</b><sub><i>i</i>+<i>n</i>+<i>j</i></sub> .
<P>
This expression/Walnut command asserts that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue–Morse_sequence">Thue-Morse sequence</a> <b>t</b> = 011010011001 &mldr;
has an overlap.  (An <i>overlap</i> is a block of the form <i>axaxa</i>, where
<i>a</i> is a single letter, and <i>x</i> is a (possibly empty) word.) 
<P>

Now Walnut returns FALSE, so this constitutes
a rigorous proof that <b>t</b> has no overlaps.
<P>

To see an automaton, use the command
<BR>
%showme <i>name</i>
<BR> where <i>name</i> is replaced
by the name of the automaton you want to see.
<P>

<H1> How can I report bugs or complain about issues?</H1>

<H1> Where can I read papers about using Walnut to solve problems?</H1>

<A href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/walnut-papers.html">This page</a> has a list of over 100 papers,
books, and theses that have used Walnut in some way to prove results 
in number theory, combinatorics on words, and other fields of discrete
mathematics.

<H1> Who are the developers of Walnut? </H1>

The principal architect of Walnut 1 was 
<a href="https://hamoonmousavi.com">Hamoon Mousavi</a>.  
<a href="https://aseemrb.me">Aseem Baranwal</a>
added features to Walnut 2.
Laindon C. Burnett added features to Walnut 3.
<a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/user/3795">Kai Hsiang Yang</a>
added features to Walnut 4.  <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/anatoly-zavyalov/">Anatoly Zavyalov</a> added
features to Walnut 5.  Anatoly Zavyalov added features
to Walnut 6, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnwnicol/">John Nicol</a> rewrote large portions of the code
to significantly improve speed and memory usage.
Walnut 7 development was by 
John Nicol.
<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/">Jeffrey Shallit</a> contributed ideas to the development of Walnut versions
1 through 7, but no actual programming.
