      <h1> What is Walnut?</h1>
      <p>
        Walnut is free software, written in Java, for
        deciding first-order statements about the non-negative
        integers, phrased in an extension of
        Presburger arithmetic, called Buchi arithmetic. It
        can be used to provide rigorous proofs or disproofs of
        hundreds of assertions in combinatorics
        on words, number theory, and other areas of discrete
        mathematics. It can handle a wide variety of problems, and has been
        used to disprove false claims in the literature, as well as solve
        open problems.

      <h1> Where can I learn more about Walnut? </h1>
      <p>
        You can buy a <a href="walnut-book.html">book</a>, or
        watch a <a href="walnut-videos.html">video</a> about Walnut,
        or look at some <a href="walnut-examples.txt">examples</a> of
        how it can be used. There are also some
        <a href="walnut-exercises.html">exercises</a> you can try once
        you have mastered the basics of Walnut.
      </p>
      <h1> Where can I download Walnut? </h1>
      <p>
        The current version of Walnut is 6.2, and can be downloaded
        for free at <a href="https://github.com/firetto/Walnut">https://github.com/firetto/Walnut</a>.
      </p>
      <h1> Where is the documentation about Walnut? </h1>
      <p>
        Currently there is no one single document with all of Walnut's features.
        The base document, about the first version of Walnut (aka Walnut 1),
        is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06017v2">this arxiv preprint</a> by Hamoon Mousavi, originally written in
        2016 and updated in 2021. Since then,
        many new features have been added to Walnut:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="walnut6-doc.pdf">Walnut 6</a> (the current version; improved speed and memory usage, added basic
          automaton operations)</li>
        <li><a href="walnut-5-doc.txt">Walnut 5</a> (support for transducers)</li>
        <li><a href="Walnut4-Documentation.txt">Walnut 4</a> (support for queries over <b>Z</b> instead of <b>N</b>)
        </li>
        <li><a href="Walnut3-NewCommands.pdf">Walnut 3</a> (provides regular expressions for k-tuples of strings;
          combine DFA's into a DFAO; convert uniform morphism to a DFAO, etc.)</li>
        <li><a href="Walnut-2.0.pdf">Walnut 2</a> (provides support for the Ostrowski numeration systems)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="walnut-book.html">Walnut book</a> also contains literally dozens and dozens of applications of
        Walnut to various problems, with code you can
        just paste in verbatim and run.
      </p>
      <h1> How do I install Walnut? </h1>
      <p>
        See <a href="walnut-installation.html">this page</a>.
      </p>
      <h1> I don't want to install it, can I just try it out in a web interface?</h1>
      <p>
        Yes! Thanks to
        <a href="https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/Nicolas.Ollinger/">Nicolas Ollinger</a>, you can go to <a
          href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nopid/jupywalnut/main">this URL</a>. It takes about 15-30 seconds to load.
        Once it loads, click the button that says "New &#9660;" and select "Walnut".
        You will now see a green rectangle. You can now type in Walnut commands
        and click "&#9654; Run" to execute them. Try, for example
      </p>
      <p>
        <tt> def tm_has_overlap "Ei,n n>=1 & At (t<=n)=> T[i+t]=T[i+n+t]": </tt>
      </p>
      <p>
        which is Walnut's way of writing the first-order logic assertion
      </p>
      <p>
        &exist; <i>i, n</i> &nbsp; <i>n</i> &ge; 1 and &forall; <i>t</i> (<i>t</i>
        &le; <i>n</i>) &rArr; <b>t</b><sub><i>i</i>+<i>t</i></sub> =
        <b>t</b><sub><i>i</i>+<i>n</i>+<i>t</i></sub> .
      </p>
      <p>
        This expression/Walnut command asserts that the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thueâ€“Morse_sequence">Thue-Morse sequence</a> <b>t</b> = 011010011001
        &mldr;
        has an overlap. (An <i>overlap</i> is a block of the form <i>axaxa</i>, where
        <i>a</i> is a single letter, and <i>x</i> is a (possibly empty) word.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Walnut returns FALSE, so this constitutes
        a rigorous proof that <b>t</b> has no overlaps.
      </p>

      <h1> Where can I read papers about using Walnut to solve problems?</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="walnut-papers.html">This page</a> has a list of over 100 papers,
        books, and theses that have used Walnut in some way to prove results
        in number theory, combinatorics on words, and other fields of discrete
        mathematics.

      <h1> Who are the developers of Walnut? </h1>
      <p>
        The principal architect of Walnut 1 was
        <a href="https://hamoonmousavi.com">Hamoon Mousavi</a>.
        <a href="https://aseemrb.me">Aseem Baranwal</a>
        added features to Walnut 2.
        Laindon C. Burnett added features to Walnut 3.
        <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/user/3795">Kai Hsiang Yang</a>
        added features to Walnut 4. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/anatoly-zavyalov/">Anatoly Zavyalov</a>
        added
        features to Walnut 5. Anatoly Zavyalov added features
        to Walnut 6, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnwnicol/">John Nicol</a> rewrote large portions of the
        code
        to significantly improve speed and memory usage.
        Walnut 7 development is currently underway by
        John Nicol and Markus Frohme.
        Jeffrey Shallit contributed ideas to the development of Walnut versions
        1 through 6, but no actual programming.
